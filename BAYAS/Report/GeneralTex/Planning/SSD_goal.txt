\textit{Goals} are user-defined conditions that must be met for the sample size to be considered sufficient. 
In general, such a condition involves an effect between parameters of the model, i.e.\ a difference between parameters, think e.g.\ of the difference between average body masses of male and female mice as the effect of sex on the parameter average body mass $\mu$. This effect is defined by the sum of the \textit{first group} of parameters minus the sum of the \textit{second group}. Remember that parameters, and thus effects, are not given by single values, but by distributions. Considering, for example, $95\%$ of the \textit{probability mass} of these distributions can lead to a more robust approach. 

ROPE (Region Of Practical Equivalence) refers to a range of values that are interpreted as de facto equal (e.g.\ because all values in ROPE are biologically indistinguishable or fall below the limit of detection of a measurement instrument). For example, you could consider body masses between two groups of mice as practically equivalent if their difference in grammes lies in interval [-1,+1] (which thus would be the ROPE). All values within this range will be treated as \textit{equal}. A possible condition for the estimation of the sample size is to have a sample size large enough to see a meaningful effect, i.e.\ an effect of a size that with high credibility \textit{excludes} the ROPE. Alternatively, if it is more probable that there is no meaningful effect, a useful condition for the sample size is the \textit{inclusion} of the probability density within the ROPE. \textit{Lower} and \textit{upper} define the ROPE limits. 

As probability distributions become more narrow -- uncertainty decreases -- with increasing sample size, another useful condition for the sample size could be that the \textit{precision} (i.e.\ the width of a probability density distribution) should be better than a given value. \\
