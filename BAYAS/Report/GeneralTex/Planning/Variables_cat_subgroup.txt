Each categorical variable is defined by its \textit{elements} and their frequencies of occurrence in a single batch. 
When a variable is \textit{capped}, batches are cut to a desired length. For example: The variable \textit{sex} with an \textit{explicit} occurrence of the elements \textit{female}(1) and \textit{male}(2) means that \textit{female} occurs once and \textit{male} twice. If the dataset length is 5 and the variable is \textit{capped}, the variable will have elements (\textit{female}, \textit{male}, \textit{male}, \textit{female}, \textit{male}). In this capped example the set (\textit{female}(1), \textit{male}(2)) or, explicitly, (\textit{female}, \textit{male}, \textit{male}) is repeated twice, and the second repeat is reduced by one \textit{male} to fit into the desired length of 5 elements. 

To allow for random variation in the occurrence of elements (in this case, the frequency is set to \textit{equal} by default), a randomization parameter is used to specify the percentage of variation between elements. For example, if \textit{male} and \textit{female} are equally distributed, but with a variation of $10\%$, the difference between the occurrences of the two elements can be at most $10\%$, e.g.\ 10 times \textit{male} and 11 times \textit{female}. 

\textit{Categorical subgroups} (or nested categoricals) are categories that exist within another broader categorical \textit{supergroup} variable. For instance, assume we have a supergoup \textit{rodent} with elements \textit{mouse} and \textit{rat}. Within that supergroup, we have a subgroup \textit{size}. In \textit{mouse}, the elements of \textit{size} are \textit{tiny} and \textit{small}, in \textit{rat}, the elements are \textit{small}, \textit{medium}, and \textit{large}. \\
