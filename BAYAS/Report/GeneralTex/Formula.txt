The formula is a mathematical representation of the model and contains important information about relations between variables. A formula of the structure ``$Y \sim X$'' means that a variable $Y$ has a distribution $X$.
Often such formulas are used to describe our prior knowledge (or \textit{prior} for short). E.g.\ if you read $\alpha \sim \text{Normal}(0,1)$ this means that \emph{we know} that a variable $\alpha$ follows a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1. 
Variables with underlined names are vectors of one or more elements. 

BAYAS internally uses the \href{http://mc-stan.org/rstanarm/}{rstanarm} software. rstanarm can automatically generate reasonable priors, but the users can also set priors themselves.

Variables with underlined names are vectors of one or more elements. These elements are listed at the end of the formula.
