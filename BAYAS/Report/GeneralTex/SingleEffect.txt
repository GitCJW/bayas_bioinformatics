An effect is a change in response variable of the model as we change a predictor variable in the model, 
e.g. the weight of a mouse (response) changes as we change sex (predictor) from male to female. 
Since model parameters are uncertain, the effects will be uncertain as well. 
Effects are therefore given by distributions that show effect sizes and uncertainties. 
The pi value (equation below) is the probability of the effect having a certain direction. 
A pi of 0 means a fifty-fifty probability of a positive or negative effect. 
A pi of 1 means that the effect clearly lies in one direction. 
CI\_low and CI\_high shows the corresponding limits of the credible interval (HDI or ETI). 

\begin{equation} 
	\pi(x) = 2 \cdot \max{ \left(  \int_{x=-\infty}^{0}  p(x) \,dx, \int_{x=0}^{\infty}  p(x) \,dx \right) } - 1
\end{equation}
