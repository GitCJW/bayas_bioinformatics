Posterior predictive checks (PPC) are comparisons of observed (input) data with data simulated using the model. 
 
If the distribution of the observed data (thick, dark curve) lies in the midst of the the simulated replicates (thin, light blue curves), 
the model is in agreement with the data and the PPC is passed.
