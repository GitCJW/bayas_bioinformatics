Predictions are given as probability distributions of the outcome variable given the posterior and a certain subset of predictor values. 
Different questions can be answered by predictions, for instance: 
What range of response values do we have to expect for a range of predictor values? 
Do prediction ranges overlap for different predictor ranges?
Differences between predictions obtained for pairs of specific predictor values are effects. 
As predictions are uncertain (given by probability distributions), effects are also uncertain.
																																					
Overlaps close to 0 suggest that predictions are clearly separated, while overlaps close to 1 indicate that predictions are nearly the same.
