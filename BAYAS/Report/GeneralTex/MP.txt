The posterior, the main outcome of Bayesian inference, is the overall probability distribution of all combinations of parameter values. 
We can break this distribution down into so-called ``marginal posteriors'', i.e. one separate probability distribution for each parameter, 
telling us for each value of the respective parameter the probability of that value.
